	<h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
	1.1 Registration with the ACT (creating an account)

	Before you book onto a face-to-face training course or e-learning course we require you to register to create an
	account and provide certain information about yourself. In doing this, you agree to:

	Provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the relevant registration form.
	Maintain and promptly update the data we hold by logging into your account and updating via ‘My profile’.
	1.2 Booking a face-to-face training or e-learning course

	Face-to-face training and e-learning courses can be booked via the booking forms available on the ACT Learning
	website. You need to be registered with the ACT before you can do this as you will be required to log in or create
	your account to complete the form.

	When you submit a booking for an online course, your submission represents an offer to the ACT to book you onto the
	course you selected. On submission of the face-to-face training course or e-learning course form you will receive an
	automated summary email of your selection.

	The ACT will accept your offer by entering your booking onto the ACT system and sending you an email confirming that
	you have been booked together with information on starting your learning.

	1.3 Prices, discounts and sales taxes/VAT

	Notice of new pricing will be given in advance, but the ACT reserves the right to change prices listed without notice.

	Early bird discounts (15% off the course fee) are available on face-to-face training courses. The early bird discount
	applies to ACT courses only (excludes ACCA and IIA courses). The discount is not available in conjunction with any
	other offer and places are subject to availability.

	If you select the rate on the booking form applicable to members of other treasury or accountancy bodies you may be
	required to provide evidence of your membership.

	If three or more people book onto the same face-to-face training course from the same organisation they qualify for a
	25% discount off the combined course fees. This discount only applies to ACT courses and cannot be used in conjunction
	with any other offer. Places are subject to availability.

	1.4 Payment

	Fees must be paid at the point of booking via Worldpay’s secure online payment process. If you have an applicable
	discount code this must be entered at the time of booking, as the discount cannot be applied retrospectively.

	We cannot invoice for fees, or accept payment, by instalments.

	All major credit and debit cards are accepted. A receipt will be sent to you by email from Worldpay confirming
	payment. Worldpay will receive the information needed to verify and authorise your payment card and to process your
	order and is under strict legal and contractual obligations not to disclose this information to third parties.

	Please note that if you do not provide accurate details (including type of card and number) or if your credit card
	company does not authorise payment, your application will be deemed void. The ACT will not accept any liability for
	costs incurred as a result of applications deemed void in this manner.

	Sales taxes (VAT, TVA etc.) are charged at the applicable rate depending on the product and/or customer.

	1.5 Prevailing terms and conditions

	Please note that this and all other ACT pre-contractual documentation shall not constitute an offer. All services
	provided by ACT are on the basis of these Terms and Conditions and if you wish to engage any ACT services we shall
	only provide them if you accept the Terms and Conditions. If you offer to engage ACT on your own terms and conditions
	then we shall only accept your offer subject to the Terms and Conditions, which shall, if we provide the services you
	offer to engage, prevail over any other terms and conditions.
